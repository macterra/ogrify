I was on the Salt Lake City to Calgary leg of my flight
from L.A. I had just finished reading the brutal Puppy
interview in Propaganda and was looking for some more
reading material. The in-flight magazine was boring so
I pulled out the barf bag and found this C program
scrawled in crayon on one side.
As far as I can tell, it's a filter program that will
convert any text file (on stdin) into Skinny Puppy lyrics.
Another input file can be specified on the command line
which contains special Ogre words. Any word in the
original text has a 5% chance of being replaced with an
Ogre word. The probability can be changed with a 2nd
command line parameter.

For instance, when I put this particular message through
the filter, using the Ogre words file tacked on at the
end, with this command line...
