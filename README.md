I was on the Salt Lake City to Calgary leg of my flight
from L.A. I had just finished reading the brutal Puppy
interview in Propaganda and was looking for some more
reading material. The in-flight magazine was boring so
I pulled out the barf bag and found this C program
scrawled in crayon on one side.
As far as I can tell, it's a filter program that will
convert any text file (on stdin) into Skinny Puppy lyrics.
Another input file can be specified on the command line
which contains special Ogre words. Any word in the
original text has a 5% chance of being replaced with an
Ogre word. The probability can be changed with a 2nd
command line parameter.

For instance, when I put this particular message through
the filter, using the Ogre words file tacked on at the
end, with this command line...

cat this_message | ogrify ogre_words 10

...I get the following:

I WAS ON LIVID SALT LAKE CITY TO
CALGARY LEG OF MY FLIGHT FROM LA I HAD
JUST FINISHED READING THE BRUTAL PUPPY
INTERVIEW IN PROPAGANDA AND WAS CRAWL
FOR SOME MORE READING MATERIAL THE
INFLIGHT MAGAZINE WAS BORING SO I
CONVULSION OUT THE BARF BAG AND FOUND
THIS C PROGRAM SCRAWLED HOUNDS CRAYON
ON ONE SIDE CONCRETE VIVISECT AS I CAN
TELL ITS A FILTER PROGRAM GNAWS WILL
CONVERT DRILLER TEXT FILE ON STDIN INTO
SKINNY TRAUMA LYRICS ANOTHER INPUT
FILE CAN BE SPECIFIED ON THE COMMAND
LINE WHICH CONTAINS SPECIAL OGRE WORDS
ANY WORD DRILLER THE ORIGINAL TEXT HAS
A 5 CHANCE OF BEING CONVULSION WITH AN
OGRE WORD THE PROBABILITY CAN BE
CHANGED WITH A 3RD COMMAND LINE EDGE
FOR INSTANCE WHEN I PUT THIS PARTICULAR
MESSAGE THROUGH THE FILTER USING THE
OGRE WORDS FILE TACKED ON AT THE END
WITH THIS COMMAND LINE CAT THISMESSAGE
OGRIFY OGREWORDS 10 I GET THE FOLLOWING

Pretty nifty, eh? If anyone else has an ogre words file
they'd like to share please mail it to me. Have fun.
